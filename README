ABOUT THIS SCRIPT
=================

This bash script was designed to automate and simplify the remote backup
process of duplicity on Amazon S3.  After your script is configured, you can
easily backup, restore, verify and clean (either via cron or manually) your
data without having to remember lots of different command options and
passphrases.

Most importantly, you can easily backup the script and your gpg key in a
convienent passphrase-encrypted file.  This comes in in handy if/when your
machine ever does go belly up.

BEFORE YOU START
================

This is a bash script that requires user configuration.  Instructions are in
the file itself and should be self-explanatory.  Be sure to replace all the
*foobar* values with your real ones.  Almost every value needs to be
configured.

After the script is configured, you can move it to /usr/local/sbin/ or wherever
you please and run it from there.  A cron job is always nice.  Be sure to make
the script executable (chmod +x) before you hit the gas.
