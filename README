**NOTE: currently, the script is undergoing some changes!  You should use version 3 (0.3) for the time being until we have all the bugs/kinks sorted out.

More information about this script avaiable at: http://damontimm.com/code/dt-s3-backup

==TO DO==

* Add a README file to the "--backup-this-script" option because, if you are like me, when it is working for so long I forget what to do when it comes time to restore
* Add --restore-dir option
* --restore-file restores to the *original* location if not alternate location is specified ... may make more sense to have it restore the current working directory first.
* add option to be able to restore a file from a specific time period (not just the latest version)

=== USAGE EXAMPLE ===
You must configure the script before using it you can config it with your favorites test editor(read comments in script).
You can put the script under bin directory of your user. If you have configured correctly your shell you will call dt-s3-backup.sh whenever you want.
Then make the script executable with "chmod +x".

==Common usage==

= View help
	$ dt-s3-backup.sh

= Run an incremental backup of configured directory
	$ dt-s3-backup.sh --backup

= Restore your backup
To restore the backup in the current work directory just run:
	$ dt-s3-backup.sh --restore ./

You can provide another directory to restore, for example: I want to restore my backup in "my_restore" folder (not created yet or existing):
	$ dt-s3-backup.sh --restore my_restore

If you don't provide a path you will prompt to answare some question to restore your backup

==Special usage==

= List files beckend up in the remote archive
	$ dt-s3-backup.sh --list-current-files

= Restore a specific file
I have deleted my favourites picture file 'mygirlfriend.jpg' present in my "Pictures" home directory, I backup it with dt-s3-backup and I can restore it with:
	$ dt-s3-backup.sh --restore-file Pictures/mygirlfriend.jpg

Now mygirlfriend.jpg is under "Pictures" directory.
But if I want to change the name when I restore it? I just need to provide a new name:
	$ dt-s3-backup.sh --restore-file Pictures/mygirlfriend.jpg Pictures/myExgirlfriend.jpg

In my Pictures directory I have myExgirlfriend.jpg.
Attention: if "Pictures" directory doesn't exist you have got an error. You must provide an existing directory.
	
= Verifies the backup
$ dt-s3-backup.sh --verify
Then you can view the verification opening the log file (that you have previously configure).
