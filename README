**NOTE: currently, the script is undergoing some changes!  You should use version 3 (0.3) for the time being until we have all the bugs/kinks sorted out.

More information about this script avaiable at: http://damontimm.com/code/dt-s3-backup

TO DO:

* Add a README file to the "--backup-this-script" option because, if you are like me, when it is working for so long I forget what to do when it comes time to restore
* Clean up general formatting of the script and make it pretty 
* give demo on how to use an "--archive-dir" option
* test --restore-file (specific) option
